<p>
This example generates signals for three different work weeks.
The instance <code>dayTypMon</code> outputs a signal with five working
days, followed by two non-working days.
The instance <code>dayTypSat</code> does the same, except that the first
days is a non-working day.
The instance <code>dayTypTwoWeeks</code> outputs six working days, followed
by 8 non-working days.
The instance <code>dayTypMonThr</code> is configured the same as
<code>dayTypMon</code>, except that it outputs the type of the day
for three days, starting with the current day, then the next day and
the day after.
