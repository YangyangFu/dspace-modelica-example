This example shows how to use an AC battery model.
</p>
<p>
The example compares three different batteries. The battery named
<code>bat_ideal</code> is ideal and it does not account for any losses.
The battery named <code>bat_loss_acdc</code> accounts for conversion losses when converting
between AC and DC.
The battery named <code>bat</code> accounts for both conversion losses and inefficiencies
during both the charge and discharge phases.
</p>
<p>
All the batteries start from the same initial condition, which is 50% of their total capacity.
The batteries are charged and discharged in the same way. The input signal <code>pow.y</code>
is the power that each battery should store or release. The signal has a duty cycle equal to 50%.
Therefore, if there are no losses the same amount of power stored into the battery will be
released and after one cycle the State of Charge (SOC) has to be equal.
</p>
<p>
The image below shows the SOC of the three batteries.
</p>

<img alt=\"alt-image\" src=\"modelica://Buildings/Resources/Images/Electrical/AC/OnePhase/Storage/Examples/SOCs.png\"/>
</p>
<p>
As expected the red line (ideal battery) maintains the SOC over the time.
The other two batteries loose some
of the initial energy due to the losses.
