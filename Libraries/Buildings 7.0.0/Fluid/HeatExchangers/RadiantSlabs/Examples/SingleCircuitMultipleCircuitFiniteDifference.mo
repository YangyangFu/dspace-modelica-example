<p>
This example compares the results of two models of a single circuit that are arranged in
parallel, versus a model that directly implements two parallel circuits.
Both configurations have the same mass flow rate and temperatures.
For simplicity, a combined convective and radiative resistance
which is independent of the temperature difference has been used.
The model is exposed to a step change in pressure, which causes forward and reverse
flow.
